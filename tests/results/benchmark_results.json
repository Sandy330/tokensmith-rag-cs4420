If a transaction aborts or the system crashes, none of its partial changes remain. Recovery enforces this using write-ahead logging (WAL) and UNDO of updates from uncommitted transactions.\n- Consistency: each transaction, if run alone, takes the database from one consistent state to another by preserving integrity constraints. The scheduler must only allow schedules that are serializable, recoverable, and preferably cascadeless so that concurrent execution does not violate consistency.\n- Isolation: concurrent execution of transactions should appear equivalent to some serial order. Concurrency control enforces this, typically via strict two-phase locking (strict 2PL): a lock manager grants shared and exclusive locks, and a transaction holds its locks until commit, preventing reads of uncommitted data and producing serializable, cascadeless schedules.\n- Durability: once a transaction commits, its effects must survive crashes. The recovery manager ensures durability by forcing log records to stable storage before commit (WAL) and using REDO during restart to reapply committed updates after a crash.\n- Putting it together: the transaction manager coordinates transactions; the concurrency-control component (for example a lock manager implementing strict 2PL) enforces isolation and helps maintain consistency; the recovery manager uses logging, checkpoints, undo, and redo to provide atomicity and durability.
